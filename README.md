## Quick intro and examples

### Directives

`ngx-dnd` provides a base set of directives to enable drag-and-drop.  By default all children of a `ngxDroppable` element may be dragged and dropped.  Add the `ngxDraggable` to restrict drag-and-drop to the parent container.

```html
<div class="ngx-dnd-container" ngxDroppable>
  <div class="ngx-dnd-item" ngxDraggable>Item 1</div>
  <div class="ngx-dnd-item" ngxDraggable>Item 2</div>
  <div class="ngx-dnd-item" ngxDraggable>Item 3</div>
</div>
```

Give  multiple containers the `dropZone` same name to allow drag-and-drop between these containers.

```html
<div class="ngx-dnd-container" ngxDroppable="example">
  <div class="ngx-dnd-item" ngxDraggable>Item 1a</div>
  <div class="ngx-dnd-item" ngxDraggable>Item 2a</div>
  <div class="ngx-dnd-item" ngxDraggable>Item 3a</div>
</div>
<div class="ngx-dnd-container" ngxDroppable="example">
  <div class="ngx-dnd-item" ngxDraggable>Item 1b</div>
  <div class="ngx-dnd-item" ngxDraggable>Item 2b</div>
  <div class="ngx-dnd-item" ngxDraggable>Item 3b</div>
</div>
```

`ngxDraggable` items can be restricted to specific containers:

```html
<div class="ngx-dnd-container" ngxDroppable>
  <div class="ngx-dnd-item" ngxDraggable="['example-target']">Item 1a</div>
  <div class="ngx-dnd-item" ngxDraggable="['example-target']">Item 2a</div>
  <div class="ngx-dnd-item" ngxDraggable="['example-target']">Item 3a</div>
</div>
<div class="ngx-dnd-container" ngxDroppable="example-target">
  <div class="ngx-dnd-item" ngxDraggable>Item 1b</div>
  <div class="ngx-dnd-item" ngxDraggable>Item 2b</div>
  <div class="ngx-dnd-item" ngxDraggable>Item 3b</div>
</div>
```

### Components

`ngx-dnd` provides a set of components that encapsulates the directives mentioned and adds capability for data driven structures.

```html
<ngx-dnd-container
  [model]="orderableLists">
</ngx-dnd-container>
```

```js
orderableLists = [
  [
    "Item 1a",
    "Item 2a",
    "Item 3a"
  ],
  [
    "Item 1b",
    "Item 2b",
    "Item 3b"
  ]
]
```

Including nested containers:

```html
<ngx-dnd-container
  [model]="nestedLists">
</ngx-dnd-container>
```

```js
nestedLists = [
  {
    "label": "Item 1",
    "children": []
  },
  {
    "label": "Item 2",
    "children": [
      {
        "label": "Item 2a",
        "children": []
      },
      {
        "label": "Item 2b",
        "children": []
      },
      {
        "label": "Item 2c",
        "children": []
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "label": "Item 3",
    "children": [
      {
        "label": "Item 3a",
        "children": []
      },
      {
        "label": "Item 3b",
        "children": []
      },
      {
        "label": "Item 3c",
        "children": []
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
